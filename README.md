# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python
## Overview
This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python. The dataset used in this project is a sample dataset related to passenger information, similar to the Titanic dataset.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your local machine. You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

### install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Usage:-Clone this repository to your local machine:




## Data Cleaning
### The data cleaning process involves:
Filling missing values in the Age and Fare columns with their respective median values.
Creating a new column CabinKnown to indicate whether a cabin number was provided.
Dropping the original Cabin column due to a high number of missing values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### The EDA process includes:

Generating summary statistics for numerical columns.
Visualizing distributions of key variables (Age, Fare, Survived) using histograms and bar charts.
Analyzing relationships between variables with scatter plots and box plots.
Creating a correlation matrix to identify correlations between variables.
Identifying patterns and trends in the data, such as survival rates based on different passenger classes, ages, and genders.
